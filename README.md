In this research endeavour, the central aim is to transcend simplistic binary classifications prevalent in the analysis of online discourse, particularly on platforms like Reddit. Instead of merely distinguishing between casual conversations and discussions related to mental health, the project aspires to undertake a comprehensive and nuanced examination of mental health ailments and their varying degrees of severity. By leveraging textual data extracted from Reddit, the study endeavours to go beyond mere identification of the type of mental health condition discussed in posts and delve into a more intricate analysis of the severity spectrum associated with these conditions. The overarching objective is to develop a sophisticated system that not only categorizes posts based on the nature of mental health issues but also incorporates a nuanced assessment of their severity levels. Furthermore, the project seeks to create a robust framework capable of assigning distinct labels, going beyond generic categorizations, and even extending to the identification of potential risk factors, such as assessing the risk of suicide within the discussed mental health context.
In order to achieve this multifaceted analysis, the research will employ advanced natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful patterns from the vast and diverse textual data available on Reddit. By discerning subtle nuances in language and content, the project aims to contribute to a more refined understanding of mental health discussions in online communities. This initiative holds significant promise not only in advancing our comprehension of mental health-related conversations but also in the development of proactive systems that can identify and address potential risks, thereby enhancing the overall well-being of individuals participating in online mental health discourse.
